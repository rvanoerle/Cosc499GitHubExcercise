Github Exercise

The goal of this program is to write two different sorting algorithms for a list in python.
The first feature will be sorting in ascending order and the second will be in descending order.

To use the first feature all you must do is clone this repository onto your location machine, make sure you have 
python installed, open the file into your preferred IDE and then hit run. 
When prompted for which order you would like the list sorted enter '0'.
If done correctly this will be the output:

Pre sorting:
[0, 7, 4, 5, 8, 3, 2, 9, 1, 6]
Test failed

Post sorting:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Test Passed

To use the second feature it will be the same setup and run as the first but when prompted for the order enter '1'.
If done correctly this will be the output:

Pre sorting:
[0, 7, 4, 5, 8, 3, 2, 9, 1, 6]
Test failed

Post sorting:
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
Test Passed
